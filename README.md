# Binary-Search-Tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

        The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
  
        The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
  
        The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


The program is implemented in C++. The program allows the user to select a choice from a list of operations. The code contains following functions:

          1. Insertion
          2. Deletion
          3. Search
          4. Minimum Value in the tree
          5. Maximum Value in the tree
          6. Successor
          7. Predecessor
          8. Depth of a node
          9. Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
          10. Delete all nodes
